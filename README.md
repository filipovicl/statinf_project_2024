# statinf_project_2024
Final project in the 054067 Models and Methods for Statistical Inference course, Spring 2024 at Politecnico di Milano

### Co-authors: Attanasio, Carlo and Bianchi, Giorgia

### Project summary
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing various numerical and categorical data related to the sales of car seats in the United States, and attempt to fit a linear model that explains the key correlations.
Using the programming language R, we analyze goodness of fit, outliers, leverage, influential points, and residuals. We also apply Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on a relevant categorical covariate. In the final steps of the project, we make use of Covariate Selection methods and Cross-Validation to further validate our model.
